<h2>Update History</h2> 
 
These update notes describe major updates relative to the 
PYTHIA 8.186 version, which was the last regular 8.1 release.
(Minor bug fixes will continue to appear.) The step from 
8.1 to 8.2 gave an occasion to break backwards compatibility,
but this should only affect a small part of the user code.

<h3>Main news by version</h3> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>8.201: 14 October 2014 
<ul> 

<li>The <i>Introduction to PYTHIA 8.2</i> has now been assigned 
the arXiv:1410.3012 [hep-ph] identifier, which has been introduced 
in code and text.</li> 

<li>The <code>enable-shared</code> by mistake was not listed
among allowed configure options.</li> 

<li>Corrected a few tiny documentation typos.</li> 

</ul> 
</li> 
 
<li>8.200: 11 October 2014 
<ul> 

<li>A new <code>share/Pythia8</code> directory collects all 
documentation and example code. The <code>examples</code>,
<code>htmldoc</code>, <code>phpdoc</code> and <code>xmldoc</code> 
directories have been moved here. The main-directory files
<code>AUTHORS</code>, <code>COPYING</code>, <code>GUIDELINE</code> 
and <code>README</code> are also copied here during installation.
</li> 
 
<li>A new <code>share/Pythia8/pdfdoc</code> directory collects pdf 
documents that are linked from the <code>htmldoc</code> and 
<code>phpdoc</code> directories. Over time it will  provide more 
in-depth descriptions of various physics aspects than offered in 
the html/php-formatted documentation. In addition to the official
main publication and the worksheet, currently notes on LO vs. NLO
PDFs and on the <i>g &rarr; q qbar</i> branching kernel are 
included.</li> 
 
<li>A new <code>include/Pythia8Plugins</code> directory collects
code that does not form part of the core PYTHIA functionality but
still has a general usefulness. Code in this directory will not be
compiled as part of the Pythia library, but can be linked where needed.
This new directory contains
<ul>
<li>the jet matching classes in <code>CombineMatchingInput.h</code>,
<code>GeneratorInput.h</code> and <code>JetMatching.h</code>, moved
from the <code>examples</code> directory;</li> 
<li>the <code>PowhegHooks</code> user hook, to veto shower emissions 
above the POWHEG scale, formerly found in <code>examples/main31.cc</code>;
</li>
<li>the <code>Pythia8ToHepMC</code> interface for output of PYTHIA events 
into the HepMC format, combining the code previously in 
<code>include/Pythia8ToHepMC.h</code> and
<code>pythia8tohepmc/Pythia8ToHepMC.cc</code> into a new 
<code>HepMC2.h</code> file;</li>
<li>the <code>FastJet3.h</code> interface of PYTHIA particles to the
FastJet 3 library of jet finders, formerly found in 
<code>include/FastJet3.h</code>; and</li> 
<li>the <code>LHAPDF5.h</code> and <code>LHAPDF6.h</code> files for 
interfaces to the LHAPDF library (see further below).</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The configure/make structure has been considerably rewritten. 
Now all external libraries to be linked are specified in the 
main-directory <code>configure</code> step, along with other options,
so there is no longer an <code>examples/configure</code>. The 
<code>make</code> step will, as before, compile and install libraries
inside the current directory, such that the main programs in the
<code>examples</code> directory can be run. One small difference is that
also the archive libraries are installed in <code>lib</code> and not in
<code>lib/archive</code>.
<br/>A new optional <code>make install</code> step allows you to copy
files to more convenient locations. The default option, with no directories
specified in the <code>configure</code> step, requires you to have 
superuser privileges. Then files will be copied to standard locations
as follows:
<table border="0">
  <tr> <td>lib/</td> <td>&rarr;&nbsp;</td> <td>/usr/lib/</td> </tr> 
  <tr> <td>include/</td> <td>&rarr;&nbsp;</td> <td>/usr/include/</td> </tr> 
  <tr> <td>share/</td> <td>&rarr;&nbsp;</td> <td>/usr/share/</td> </tr> 
  <tr> <td>pythia-config</td> <td>&rarr;&nbsp;</td> <td>/usr/bin/</td> </tr> 
</table> 
</li> 

<li>
The <code>pythia8-config.in</code> script has been replaced by a new
<code>bin/pythia8-config</code> script. See the README file for details.
The <code>make install</code> step by default will put a copy of it in
<code>/usr/bin</code>.
</li> 

<li>The interface to LHAPDF is now dynamically loaded when requested,
and can be either to version 5 or 6 of the library. The dummy code   
previously in <code>lhapdfdummy/LHAPDFDummy.cc</code>, to be linked
when LHAPDF is not, is no longer required. The two new files
<code>LHAPDF5.h</code> and <code>LHAPDF6.h</code> in the
<code>include/Pythia8Plugins</code> directory contain the necessary
interface code. The selection of PDF sets, notably for the proton, 
has been extended to simplify mixing of internal and external PDF sets,  
and it is now possible to specify different PDFs for the two incoming
protons at the LHC, see the <a href="PDFSelection.html" target="page">PDF Selection</a>
description.</li> 

<li>The new <code>LHEF3.h</code> file contains a generic interface for
reading Les Houches Event Files of versions 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. This 
allows more information to be read and studied by the author. Currently
PYTHIA itself makes little use of the information beyond the one in 1.0,
but it is available among the 
<a href="EventInformation.html" target="page">Event Information</a>.
Examples are found in <code>main37.cc</code> and <code>main38.cc</code>. 
</li> 
 
<li>The new <code>Beams:strictLHEFscale</code> switch can be used to
restrict parton showers in resonance decays to be below the input
Les Houches scale, not only the hard process itself.
The new <code>Beams:setProductionScalesFromLHEF</code> switch can be used
to restrict the emission off each separate parton to be below its specific
scale.</li> 

<li>The <code>rootexamples</code> directory has been removed, and the
two programs <code>examples/main91</code> and <code>examples/main92</code>
now illustrate how ROOT can be used in conjunction with PYTHIA.</li> 

<li>The executable built from <code>examples/mainxx.cc</code> is now 
named <code>examples/mainxx</code>, while previously it was named
<code>examples/mainxx.exe</code>.</li> 

<li>The rudimentary support for compilation on Windows platforms,
present in PYTHIA 8.1, has not yet been updated for 8.2 and so is omitted.
Also the README.HepMC file is omitted for now.</li> 

<li>The ProMC interface is broken, and has been removed for now.</li> 

<li>Several methods have been removed from the <code>Event</code> class
since the properties now instead can be accessed from the individual 
<code>Particle</code> instance, if this particle belongs to an event.
These include <code>iTopCopy</code>, <code>iBotCopy</code>,
<code>iTopCopyId</code>, <code>iBotCopyId</code>,<code>motherList</code>,  
<code>daughterList</code>, <code>sisterList</code>,
<code>sisterListTopBot</code>, <code>isAncestor</code>,
<code>statusHepMC</code> and <code>undoDecay</code>.</li> 
 
<li>A number of deprecated <code>Pythia::init(...)</code> methods with
varying arguments have been removed. Instead call <code>init()</code>
without any arguments and use 
<a href="BeamParameters.html" target="page">Beam Parameters</a> settings to
specify beams and energies in different ways.</li> 
 
<li>The deprecated <code>Pythia::statistics(...)</code> method has been
removed; instead use <code>Pythia::stat(...)</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Several settings in the <code>Main:</code> series have been removed.
Most of these have already found replacements in the <code>Init:</code>,
<code>Next:</code> and <code>Stat:</code> ones, and have been marked as 
deprecated. Four further ones were deemed so peripheral that they were
removed altogether, but of course the underlying functionality remains.
</li> 
 
<li>A few aliases for (parts of) settings names have been removed.
Previously "Multiple" was mapped to "Multiparton", "MI" to "MPI" and
"minBias" to "nonDiffractive" if a settings name was not found for the 
original input string.</li> 
 
<li>The default tune has been changed from 4C to Monash 2013, meaning
<code>Tune:ee = 7</code> and <code>Tune:pp = 14</code>. The old 4C
tune that was default in 8.1 can be recovered with 
<code>Tune:ee = 3</code> and <code>Tune:pp = 5</code>.
Also most other older tunes are based on <code>Tune:ee = 3</code>.
</li> 
 
<li>Two new CMS underlying-event tunes [<a href="Bibliography.html" target="page">CMS14</a>] and the ATLAS
AZ tune [<a href="Bibliography.html" target="page">ATL14</a>] have been added as options.</li> 
 
<li>The default handling of the <i>g &rarr; q qbar</i> splitting kernel
has been changed, affecting in particular heavy-flavour production. 
<code>TimeShower:weightGluonToQuark</code> has been changed from 1 to 4
to do this. All old tunes are with the 1 value but, since the tunes are
not probing the detailed <i>g &rarr; q qbar</i> behaviour, this is
not set as part of the tune options.</li> 
 
<li>Christine O. Rasmussen joins as new PYTHIA collaboration member.</li> 
 
<li>A new model for the handling of <a href="BeamRemnants.html" target="page">beam 
remnants</a> as an option to the old one, which remains as default
for now.</li> 
 
<li>Two new models for <a href="ColourReconnection.html" target="page">colour 
reconnection</a>, one quite sophisticated and one simpler.
This involves several new classes and files. It also includes some 
changes in the hadronization framework, notably for the handling of 
junctions. The old model remains as default for now. The 
<code>BeamRemnants:reconnectColours</code> flag to switch on/off
reconnection has been renamed <code>ColourReconnection:reconnect</code>,
the main parameter <code>BeamRemnants:reconnectRange</code> of the old
model has been renamed <code>ColourReconnection:range</code>, and several
new settings have been introduced, notably 
<code>ColourReconnection:mode</code> to switch among the three models.
</li> 

<li>A new <code>include/Pythia8Plugins/ColourReconnectionHooks.h</code> 
makes available an even larger selection of toy colour reconnection 
models, via user hooks. Some of them are only intended for top decays, 
for top mass uncertainty studies, whereas others can be used more 
generally. The <code>examples/main29.cc</code> program illustrates how 
the different options should be set up.</li> 

<li>Several new features and improvements in the matching/merging 
machinery. Notably the aMC@NLO matching scheme has been implemented,
see the <a href="aMCatNLOMatching.html" target="page">aMC@NLO Matching</a>
description. To this end the global-recoil option of timelike showers
has been improved, and security checks have been introduced for 
inaccurate LHEF input. A new <code>main89.cc</code> example has been
introduced, where different <code>.cmnd</code> files show how to set
up either CKKW-L, FxFx, MLM, UMEPS or UNLOPS merging.</li>

<li>Improved capability for the <code>LHAup</code> Les Houches interface 
to read SLHA information embedded in the input file or stream.</li> 

<li>The <code>Makefile</code>s have been updated to take into account
the changed structure of the HepMC interface.</li> 

<li>The <i>Z'</i> production process has been updated to optionally
allow decay to a fourth generation of fermions, with universal or
non-universal couplings.</li> 

<li>Introduction of a new Higgs CP-mixing parametrization via a mixing
angle <i>phi</i> as described in <a href="HiggsProcesses.html" target="page">Higgs
Processes</a>. The choice of the Higgs CP-mixing parametrization
now also affects the distributions of the <i>tau</i> decay products
from the processes <i>H^0 &rarr; tau^+ tau^-</i>.

<li>Bug fix in <i>H^0 &rarr; W^+ W^- &rarr; 4 f</i> matrix element
for mixed CP-state case.</li>

<li>Various improvements and finer grain control for the determination
of <i>tau</i> decay correlations and <i>tau</i> polarizations. By
default the decays of <i>tau</i> pairs from known resonance decays
in Les Houches input are now correlated.
The <code>ParticleDecays:sophisticatedTau</code> mode
in <a href="ParticleDecays.html" target="page">Particle Decays</a> has been renamed
<code>TauDecays:mode</code>, as well as all <i>tau</i>-related 
<code>ParticleDecay</code> options, with two new options of
using only the internal machinery to determine correlations and
polarizations, and only using the provided SPINUP digit from Les
Houches input. The option <code>TauDecays:externalMode</code> has been
introduced to control the interpretation of the SPINUP digit.
</li> 

<li>For Les Houches Event input the energy of a particle is recalculated
from its three-momentum and mass, in order to limit mismatches from
limited numerical precision in the input values.</li>
 
<li>Bug fix in the two-loop running <i>alpha_s</i>, for the matching 
to six flavours at the top mass.</li> 
 
<li>Eliminate harmless compiler warnings for <code>FJcore</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Updated Introduction (= the official 8.2 article) and Worksheet.</li>
